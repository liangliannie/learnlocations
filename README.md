# learn locations
This is a start for me to touch skilearn! This package has been made super powerful!

The task is to do regression on real locations and classification on building ID and floor number on the UJIIndoorLoc database. Just play around this data, you could learn a lot about machine learning, such as dimensional reductions, data norlimiazation, so so more! 


I will update this later for beginners in skilearn and basic machine learning to show what I have learned based this data!
